# EcoMap Egypt: Climate Change Insights

## Project Overview

**EcoMap Egypt: Climate Change Insights** is an interactive web-based tool designed to visualize the impacts of climate change on Egypt. This project integrates geospatial and climate data to create an engaging and informative platform that allows users to explore climate risk scenarios. The platform provides valuable insights into how climate change, including temperature variations, sea-level rise, and precipitation changes, is expected to affect different regions in Egypt.

This tool is a resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public to better understand climate risks and make data-driven decisions for environmental sustainability and adaptation.

## Features

![Map Features](Features.png)

- **Interactive Map**: View climate change projections and their impacts on various Egyptian regions, using a user-friendly, zoomable map interface.
- **Climate Data Visualization**: The platform integrates climate data such as temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise to illustrate how these factors evolve over time.
- **Geospatial Data Integration**: Uses shapefiles and geo-referenced climate data to provide accurate visualizations of climate impacts.
- **Custom Reports**: Users can generate downloadable reports based on their exploration of the map.


## Key Technologies

This project utilizes a combination of Python, JavaScript, and mapping libraries to build the interactive experience:

- **Python**: For backend processing and creating visualizations using climate data.
- **Folium**: A Python library for generating interactive maps with Leaflet.js.
- **Leaflet.js**: JavaScript library for rendering interactive maps on the web.
- **Shapefiles**: Geographic data format used to define boundaries and regions within the map.
- **HTML/CSS**: To build the frontend interface.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances map interactivity and user interaction with climate data layers.
